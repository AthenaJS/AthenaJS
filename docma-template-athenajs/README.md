Docma template for AthenaJS which is basically Docma's default [Zebra](https://onury.io/docma/templates/zebra) template with a few modifications:

 - toggle tree when clicking on the full label
 - collapse every definition by default
 - remove hambuger menu and reduce header size instead (but perfect, but media queries breakpoint isn't either, and this allows to use the search correctly)
