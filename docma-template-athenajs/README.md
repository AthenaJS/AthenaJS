Docma template for AthenaJS which is basically Docma's default [Zebra](https://onury.io/docma/templates/zebra) template with a few modifications:

 - toggle tree when clicking on the full label
 - use table for parameters which are more easier have a quick glance at
 - collapse every definition by default
